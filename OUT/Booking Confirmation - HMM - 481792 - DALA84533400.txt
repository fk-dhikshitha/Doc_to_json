  Port cut-off (US) (RF) 2022/09/12 16:00
 *CAN.USA Trans-border Cargo Doc Cut-off: 48HRS prior to INL Rail cut-off. *Early Return subject to Storage Charges
*Terminal 1st receiving and HMM DEM Free ERD may differ. If container is returned prior to DEM free ERD, you will be charged for each day, up to, and including vessel berthing date. If vessel is delayed following return of the container, demurrage will terminate on the scheduled day of vessel berth at the time of container ingate.
HMM applies a Ò48 HRÓ rule to all INL cutoff dates when a vessel schedule change occurs. This rule is intended to reduce any inconvenience or service disruption to you, our valued customer. In case port cutoff changes within 48 HRs before the current ERD begins and beyond, your ERD and RAIL CUTOFF DATES WILL NOT CHANGE.
If schedule has changed within this window, and you would prefer the revised ERD / Rail Cutoff, please contact your regional customer service team to provide.
